Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build, By individually testing each added function.

During development I made use of codeanywhere debugger to resolve bugs and non logical behavior.

I have also used  [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)  Validator to check code for errors.

### Known Bugs

| Known Bug No | Bug Issue | Plan to Resolve |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The application stops if one of the spread sheets is not online because the constants for the spread sheets is declared before any try: block. There is a way to wrap the constants in a try: block but I think it is an overkill and there must be some elegant way to do it.  | try another way to declare the spread sheets names may be not constants|


### Solved Bugs

| Bug No | Bug Issue | How Resolved |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Used match case in parts of the code, and it did not work.  After checking the python version on codeanywhere found that it was not up to date.| Rewrote the code with if elif blocks|
| 2 | when entering space in a user input the application stops | all the user input is validated |
| 3 | when topping-up and the alarms spread sheet is empty it gives an error | added code that verifies if the spread sheet is empty |
| 4 | updating the address cell always gives a warning of a deprecated function even though it is from there official page | changed the function name to a one found on stackoverflow |
