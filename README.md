# VendingApp

The VendingApp application is an imitation of a real-life vending machines system connected to a database.
The user can: 
create and delete vending machines. 
Imitate the process of buying items from a vending machine.
Maintain a vending machine (top-up, cashing)
Database contains:
Vending machines info.
Sales info.
Stock quantity alarms.

## **User Experience (UX)**

<br>

### **Initial Discussion**
For the rest of the document, I'll be using vm instead of vending machine and vms for plural.
The main idea of the application is to provides a way to administrate vms.
The user can create several initially stocked vms and monitor the process of selling the stocked items. The information is stored online in a three google spreadsheets:
VendingMachine - contains information about the vms (address, operation, stock, date, and time)
VendingSales - contains information about the item sold and the revenue.
Alarms - contains information about the items being almost or out of stock.
The user can top-up the vm or cash the money if needed.

### **User Stories**

**Goals**

- To be able to create several vms.
- To be able to delete vms.
- To be able to choose specific vm.
- To be able to buy from a vm. 
- To be able to top-up a vm. 
- To be able to cash a vm. 
- To provide the user with a way to check the stock on each vm. 
- To provide the user with a way to check the alarms for each vm. 
- To provide the user with a way to check the sales and revenue for each vm.

## **Features**
### **Existing Features**

The app is a terminal interface with options that the user can choose from.

-   When executed it starts with general information about the application. And then interact with the user depending on his options.
    <details close>
    <summary>Start</summary>

    ![start](documentation/start.jpg)

    </details>
    <br>
-   There are three main spreadsheets: VendingMachine,VendingSales, and Alarms. Each spreadsheet contains a template which the application use when creating a new vm.

    <summary>Spread Sheets</summary>

    ![sales](documentation/sale-templates-sale.jpg)

    ![alarms](documentation/sale-templates-alarm.jpg)

    </details> 
    <br>
- When a new vm is created in each spreadsheet appears a new worksheet with a generated name, vm + number (vm01), the name is generated automatically and is validated for repetitions and always ordered. example - if we have three vms (vm01, vm02, vm03) and vm02 is deleted (vm01, vm03). Then the user wanted to add a new vm. the generated name will be (vm02) and not (vm04).

- The user always gets feed back on each operation including when errors occurs.

    <summary>Feed Back</summary>

- Every user input is validated and the user gets feed back regarding the current operation.

    <br>
- On each operation the remaining stock, cash, and revenue is calculated separately and the database updates.
    
    - One item sold (mars):

### **Future Features**
- send The user an email or SMS when an alarm occurs.     

## **Data Model**
I decided to go with classes to separate the logic in to groups.
There are four classes:

- VM_Logic class: The logic behind the data and the database. 
- Admin class: The logic behind administrating vms. 
- Vending_Machine class: The logic behind the vm operations. 
- VM_UI class: The interactions with the user (user interface).

The processes of writing and retrieving data from API is handled fully by the VM_Logic class. The processes of calculating stock, sale, and revenue when choosing and purchasing an item or servicing the vm is handled by the Vending_Machine class. The processes of adding deleting vms is handled by the Admin class. And finally all the user interactions, menus and notifications is handles by the VM_UI class.

### Code Used

- Most of the solutions to coding problems I encountered where taken from the [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [Python website](https://www.python.org/) websites and off course [Stack over flow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

- Code related to API mostly used the official documentation [google sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest) and [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/v5.2.0/index.html)

- Some of the code used was inspired from the Code Institute python project LoveSandwiches like the use of zip in for loops.
